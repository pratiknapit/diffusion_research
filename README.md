Diffusion research, starting from VAEs.

Projects list:
1. vae_mnist
    - Description: write a simple vae in pytorch to generate images of the number 1.
2. conditional_vae_mnist
    - Description: write a conditional vae in pytorch to generate images depending on passed in number.
3. hvae_mnist:
    - Description: same as vae_mnist but using heirarchical vae (HVAE)
4. diffusion_mnist:
    - Description: same as hvae_mnist but using diffusion model.
